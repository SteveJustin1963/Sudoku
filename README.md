# Sudoku

Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle game played on a 9x9 grid, divided into nine 3x3 subgrids. The objective is to fill the entire grid with numbers from 1 to 9, following these rules:

1. Each row must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.
3. Each 3x3 subgrid must also contain the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.

Some numbers are pre-filled as clues, and the challenge is to deduce the placement of the remaining numbers based on the rules. Itâ€™s a game of logic, not math, and requires reasoning to solve.
